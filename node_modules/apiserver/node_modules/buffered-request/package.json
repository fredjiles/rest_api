It still works well with `pipes` and `data` events.\n\nTake a look ad the test suite for some example.\n\n## Installation\n\n    ⚡ npm install buffered-request\n\n```javascript\nrequire('buffered-request')\n```\n\n## Syntax\n\n```javascript\nIncomingMessage.makeBuffered()\n```\n\n## Example\n\n```javascript\nvar server = http.createServer(function (request, response) {\n  request.makeBuffered() // ensure that you will never lose packets\n  request.pause()\n  setTimeout(function () {\n    request.on('data', function (chunk) {\n      // data event will be emitted for all previous buffered chunks\n    })\n    request.resume()\n  }, 1000)\n  ...\n}).listen(8080)\n```\n\n## Test\n\n    ⚡ npm install\n    ⚡ npm test\n\n## Test Coverage\n\n    ⚡ npm install -g jscoverage\n    ⚡ make test-cov\n    \n## License\n\n_This software is released under the MIT license cited below_.\n\n    Copyright (c) 2010 Kilian Ciuffolo, me@nailik.org.
